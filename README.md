I started my first few days of Investopedia and I did what all new people to the stocks do, invest in the big names that you hear all the time and this is where i ended up, not great. Now I must listend to what everyone is saying and watch the videos incuded in the website, which is watch the news and look for oppurtunites. No don't worry a 17 year old itsn't that rich it's pretend money, which I like to play about with and seek best oppurtunites. This has helped me gain many skills and it will help me furter on.
