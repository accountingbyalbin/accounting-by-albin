(30th August 20205) I started my first few days of Investopedia and I did what all new people to the stocks do, invest in the big names that you hear all the time and this is where i ended up, not great. Now I must listend to what everyone is saying and watch the videos incuded in the website, which is watch the news and look for oppurtunites. No don't worry a 17 year old itsn't that rich it's pretend money, which I like to play about with and seek best oppurtunites. This has helped me gain many skills and it will help me further on.

(4th August 2025) This week on Investopedia’s stock simulator, my virtual portfolio saw some interesting movements. Here’s a breakdown of my performance, lessons learned, and what I might do next. Despite the negative cash balance (likely from margin usage), my overall return remains strong — a sign that some positions are working in my favor.Clearly, Microsoft dominates my portfolio with a massive $100,476.60 position. The 1-week chart shows a spike midweek followed by a noticeable dip, ending with a leveling off. This reflects how quickly sentiment can shift in the market — a reminder that timing plays a huge role in trading.
